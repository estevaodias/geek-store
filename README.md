## About

[Geek Store](https://www.linkedin.com/in/diasestevao/) is an OSS ecommerce initiative.

## Contributing to Geek Store

Currently, I'm using [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/) for commit messages and the default Intellij IDEA code style with two spaces instead of four.

I don't have any contribution guide, but feel free to submit a pull request if you want to.
